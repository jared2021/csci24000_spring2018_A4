The goal of this program is to read in a file of students, store those students on the Stack, and then pop off and print each student
The input of this program is textfile that we want to copy and the button prompts they will use to run the program
The output of this program is printing out the contents of the textfile we copied
The user will be given a menu with three options 1)Load students from the textfile 2)Print students 3)Close the program
When the user hits 1 the program will scan the textfile, divide it by each line of the textfile and then divide the lines by each "," and store it in a string array to be passed to the Student and Address classes, and finallyl store each Student in our Stack ADT
When the user hits 2 the program will pop out each Student off of our Stack ADT and print them out
